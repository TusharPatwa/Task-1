OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

To-Do List: Project Overview
Why I Made This?
We all have things to do and keeping track of them can get tricky sometimes. That’s why I created this simple To-Do List app! It's a straightforward tool to jot down tasks, manage them, and keep life a bit more organized. It’s not overcomplicated—just a clean interface that does the job.

What It Does?
1.	Add Tasks:
o	Just type in whatever you need to do and hit the "Add" button. It’ll appear in the list below.
2.	View Your Tasks:
o	The app keeps your tasks neatly organized in a list. Each task has a "Delete" button in case you finish it or decide it’s no longer needed.
3.	Delete Tasks:
o	Got something done? Great! Click "Delete" next to the task, and it’s gone.
4.	Looks Good, Feels Good:
o	I’ve kept the design simple, clean, and centered. It looks great on desktop, and it’s not too bad on mobile either.

What I Used?
•	HTML: For the bones of the app—the structure, input field, buttons, and list.
•	CSS: To make it look nice. Subtle shadows, alternate colors for tasks, and a bit of hover magic on the buttons.
•	JavaScript: The brains behind it all. It makes the app interactive: adding tasks, deleting them, and managing the list dynamically.

How It Works?
1.	You Type It:
	There’s a text box where you can type in what you need to do.
2.	You Add It:
Click the "Add" button, and your task pops into the list below.
3.	You Manage It:
	If you finish or don’t need a task anymore, just click "Delete" to remove it from the list.

What’s Next? 
This version is basic, but I’ve got some cool ideas for improvements:
•	Save Tasks: Make it so your tasks don’t disappear when you refresh the page (using Local Storage).
•	Edit Tasks: Let you tweak a task if you make a mistake or things change.
•	Prioritize Tasks: Add a way to mark tasks as "High Priority" or group them by importance.
•	Themes: Maybe some color themes so you can personalize the look.

Why This Project?
This To-Do List is a great way to practice the basics of web development. It’s small enough to finish quickly but still has enough moving parts to be interesting. Plus, it’s something people can actually use!
